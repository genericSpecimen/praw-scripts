# praw-scripts

Some scripts I wrote using PRAW: The Python Reddit API Wrapper.

## Usage

You need to install [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) first.

Then, you need to create an application of type 'script' from [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). Make sure you are logged into Reddit.

After creating the application, you'll get client\_id and client\_secret. In the [praw.ini](./praw.ini) file, enter these fields. Enter user\_agent, which can be anything you want. It is used to identify your script. Enter your reddit username and password, and you're good to go!
